However, if you prefer to have indoor shots, I recommend using the comfort of your own home as this will help you relax and get the best natural photos. Alternatively, I am happy to offer my own personal studio in my house. I am happy to discuss all the options with you."

            q: "How long does it take to receive my pictures?",

Id also recommend booking your photoshoot before the 38th week because things can get a little uncomfortable towards the end. At the end of the day though, all stages of pregnancy are beautiful and I just want to capture this magical moment in your life"

When they start crawling and walking however, I recommend the family package because this includes a longer photoshoot which, trust me, is necessary to get a decent number of quality photos.."

However, if there is something you'd particularly like, just let me know. My request however is that you're the one who poses your child as you know them best and they will be most comfortable with you."
